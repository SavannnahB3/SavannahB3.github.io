            Anna Lucille was one of 1,428 dogs available for adoption in Alabama on PetFinder, September 20, 2019. But Anna
            Lucille didn’t originate in Alabama. According to her description, she was brought into the state from a rough
            situation in Florida.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the day that Anna Lucille was available, < 1% of the adoptable dogs in Alabama came into the local rescues
            and shelters from out of state.
